Problem Statement - 
The system features two heaters that activate at different temperature thresholds: the first heater
engages when the temperature drops below 20 degrees Celsius, while the second heater
activates when the temperature falls below 10 degrees Celsius. Ideally, the temperature should
remain between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius for optimal conditions. However, if the temperature
exceeds 25 degrees Celsius, a fan should activate.
The fan should operate at different speeds based on the temperature range:
• At temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius, the fan operates at LEVEL 1.
• Between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius, the fan speed increases to LEVEL 2.
• When the temperature exceeds 35 degrees Celsius, the fan operates at LEVEL 3 to
efficiently cool the environment.

The ambient temperature in degree Celsius, the ON/OFF action of heater 1 and heater 2 (HTR1
and HTR2) as well as fan speed (LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 and LEVEL 3) are displayed on LCD
panel.
